### Please, make sure you are using:

## Node Version:

`10.16.1`

## React Version:

## Setup

To run the project locally:

- clone this repository
- open 2 terminal windows

API Server:

- in one of the terminals navigate to "api" directory
- run $npm install
- run $npm start
  (if you are seeing "YAY! Api server is running on port: 3001" in your terminal, it means your backend server is started successfully. If you'd like to see the data array - go to http://localhost:3001)

CLIENT Server:

- in THE OTHER terminal navigate to "client" directory
- run $npm install
- with your api server running in the API terminal, run $npm start in the CLIENT terminal
  (the app should open in a new tab, if it doesn't, you can go to http://localhost:3000 to see it)
