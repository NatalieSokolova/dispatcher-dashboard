# Rose Rocket Coding Challenge

A basic dispatcher dashboard application to manage the tasks of drivers

## Setup

To run the project locally:

- clone this repository
- open 2 terminal windows

API Server:

- navigate to "api" directory
- in one of the terminals run $npm install
- run $npm start
  (if you are seeing "YAY! Api server is running on port: 3001" in your terminal, it means your backend server is started successfully. If you'd like to see the data array - go to http://localhost:3001)

CLIENT Server:

- navigate to "client" directory
- in THE OTHER terminal run $npm install
- with your api server running in the API terminal, run $npm start in the CLIENT terminal
  (the app should open in a new tab, if it doesn't, you can go to http://localhost:3000 to see it)
